 This is the first attempt at providing support for the CxxTest C++ unit test
 framework as ThirdParty software. The developers of Osi2 are thinking of
 using it for testing.

 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

 CxxTest runs a python script, cxxtestgen, that creates the source (.cpp)
 file for a unit test driver. In order to create this driver, it scans source
 files containing test methods for the code to be tested and integrates what
 it finds with boilerplate that comes with the CxxTest distribution. So it's a
 bit different from other ThirdParty codes.

 As currently configured,
   * cxxtestgen is installed in <builddir>/bin
   * the boilerplate is copied into <builddir>/include/cxxtest
   * the various python modules are copied into <builddir>/lib (this is
     almost certainly wrong and likely to change very soon)
